# Profiling Apps from the App Store and Google Play Markets for Potential Lucrative Markets
My aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. Assume I'm a data analyst for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and my job is to enable the team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps to build.

At the company, they only build apps that are free to download and install, and their main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use an app. My goal for this project is to analyze data to help the developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.
